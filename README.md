# LLMs for Medical Educators: 2025 Reference Guide

A curated, educator-friendly reference for **general-purpose Large Language Models** that medical and health professions educators can readily access for teaching, assessment, and educational research.

> **Snapshot disclaimer (August 2025):** Capabilities, pricing, and access tiers change frequently. Always confirm details with the official links provided before institutional adoption.

## Why this guide exists

Medical educators need practical guidance on which AI tools are actually available, reliable, and suitable for educational use. This site focuses on **mainstream, accessible LLMs** rather than specialized medical AI models that most educators cannot access or evaluate properly.

**What you'll find here:**
- Current consumer and developer LLM options with clear access requirements
- Free vs. paid tier comparisons relevant to educational budgets
- Key capabilities that matter for health professions education (HPE)
- Quick-start guidance for GitHub Pages deployment

## How educators are already using these tools

- Generating **feedback on student essays** using structured rubrics  
- Designing **interactive case-based discussions** with multimodal prompts  
- Supporting **faculty development** (workshop outlines, role-play scripts)  
- Summarizing **large policy or curricular documents** for busy committees

## Evidence and cautions for educators
- Reviews of LLMs in medical education and assessment discuss opportunities and persistent limitations such as study quality and outcome measurement. See Lucas et al. 2024, Vrdoljak et al. 2025, Gordon et al. 2024, Feigerlova et al. 2025.  
- WHO guidance outlines ethics and governance considerations for large multimodal models in health.  
- AAMC resources summarize readiness, curriculum adoption, and responsible use in academic medicine.
